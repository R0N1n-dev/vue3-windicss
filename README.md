# Using Vue 3 & Windi CSS with less of a learning curve

#### This sample app is using vanilla Vue 3. The point of this is to prove that Windi CSS can be used just like regular CSS. Only difference is that "@apply" and the class names are used.

## Example

### Instead of using:
```
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
```

### You will be using:
```
h1 {
  @apply text-blue-500;
}
```
#### The only learning curves with this is figuring out all of the Windi CSS class names and having to add "@apply". Vetur can help with this.

#### Have fun and happy coding!
